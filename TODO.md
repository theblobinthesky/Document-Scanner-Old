TODO: Must have performance improvements and general engine changes aswell as visual changes.
* Async asset streaming, e.g. neural networks, textures.
* Async camera opening.

* Shader compilation binary caching.
* Profiling?
* More composable graphics, especially respecting rounded corners
* Gradient rendering, SDF animations
* Asset packing, using mmap avoiding memcpy
